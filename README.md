- Hi, I’m @NT00Truc
- 
- I’m a mechatronic student at Oslo Metropolitan University in Norway.
- I be finishing my 4th semester this summer and are looking for opportunities within automation, control system and robotic.
- I’m open to other opportunities as well since, I have a high interest in mathematics, physics and programming in python and currently learning C++ in my spare time.
